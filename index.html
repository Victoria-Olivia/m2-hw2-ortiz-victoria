<h1>Victoria Olivia</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Victoria Olivia. I am a graduate student at the University of Florida, studying Mass Communication. I am interested in creative writing and film cinema studies. I also enjoy graphic design because it allows me to provoke emotion and communicate with an audience vividly from anywhere in the world. 
    My career goal is to be able to publish my author page professionally to showcase my projects. I would also like to work for Yellow Shoes as a graphic designer. 
    One of my favorite hobbies in my spare time is creating coloring books for my little one. Without experience and the snowball effect, I created a brand and a website for the coloring collection. It’s still under major construction, and I’m learning about it now. Click on the link to check out my website.
